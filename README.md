# Data Cleaning of Housing Dataset with SQL

  Data forms the backbone of any data analytics you do. **Data cleaning** is the process of editing, correcting, and structuring data within a data set so that itâ€™s generally       uniform and prepared for analysis. 
  This includes
  - Removing irrelevent and duplicate Values
  - Dealing with missing data
  - Formatting Data for analysis
  - Fixing structural errors
  
 This Project is purely based on SQL Server , employing its innate capabilities : **String Functions , Window Functions , Joins , CTE**
